            <span>I have many years of experience in digital art so naturally I felt the next step was to dabble in animation. So over quarantine, I combined my goal of animating and my favourite hobby at the time, watching streams, together. I was heavily inspired by the game lore done by some of my favourite streamers, and created For Clay. A story about losing a friend unexpectedly due to cancer when recovery seemed near. What started as a passion project, wanting to create a proper animation, became more of an animatic. But through the use of sound design, pacing, and the warm colours of my piece, I still was able to convey something intimate. I aim for this piece to feel emotional and for the viewer to experience the sentiments together with the main female character so therefore the ending should feel unexpected.              </span>
